### Introduction

The SCA requires each person who wishes to participate in competitive
combat to pass a safety test before participating in tournaments or
melees. This test is called an authorization and is intended to verify
that you understand the rules and that you have sufficient control to be
safe on the field.

This FAQ document is focused on authorizing as an adult rapier combatant
in the Kingdom of Atlantia, but most of the information will be
applicable to any combat form in any Kingdom.

### Practices

You are not required to be authorized in order to participate in
practices, however before participating you must sign a waiver. Before
fighting (at either a practice or an event) you must also be inspected
to make sure that your armor and weapons meet the safety regulations.
Your local marshal (safety officer) and other experienced fencers will
teach you the basics and give you feedback on when they feel you're
ready to authorize.

While your actual authorization will be administered by marshals who are
not your regular practice partners, you are encouraged to ask your local
marshals to perform a practice (or "mock") authorization with you. Doing
so will teach you what to expect and allow you to be less stressed for
the actual test.

### Before you authorize

Read and understand the rules!

Start with the [SCA Society level rules](/rules). Then read the [Atlantian Kingdom level rules](/rules). These Kingdom level rules add a few more details and restrictions to the Society rules but are not intended to be a stand alone document.

Participate in at least one mock authorization with your local marshals.  (recommended)

### Authorizing Day

Ask your more experienced friends for a good event to go authorize at.
There need to be at least two marshals there who are not your regular
practice partners. Most times this is not a problem, but a small local
event may not meet this requirement.

Wear your pre-17th century clothing and bring your armor and weapon(s),
event fee, and \$5.00 authorization fee (required only if you pass).
Check the schedule for the event. Authorizations are generally one of
the earliest items on the schedule so that people who pass can then
participate in the tournament later in the day. If you arrive late, you
may not be able to authorize that day depending on how tight the
schedule is.

Your first stop at the event is the event check-in (also called "Troll"). Here you'll pay the event fee. If you are not a member of the SCA you'll pay a \$3 surcharge and sign a waiver.

Your next step is to locate the Minister of the List (MoL) table. This
table is generally near the fighting field, but at some events it may be
at the event check in. Tell them you'd like to authorize in rapier today
and they'll add you to the list. Once most people have signed in with
the MoL, the rapier Marshal in Charge (RMiC) will check with the MoL and
start assigning marshal teams to candidates. Try to listen for your name
or for other announcements that authorizations are starting.

### Your Authorization

The first part of your authorization is a short verbal quiz to verify
that you understand the rules. They should start with:

1.  Have you checked in with Troll?
2.  Have you checked in with the MoL?
3.  Have you read and understood the rules for rapier in Atlantia?
4.  Describe the armor requirements.
5.  Describe the weapon requirements.
6.  Describe valid blows.
7.  Describe valid target locations and the effect of valid blows on
    them.
8.  Describe engagement in melee

The quiz portion should not take very long. Five minutes is typical. Ten
should be the top end.

The second part of your authorization is the practical test. The two
marshals will select a skilled, authorized, opponent (called the
"usher") to test you. Before fighting, they'll perform an inspection of
your gear to make sure it's safe, legal, and that you haven't forgotten
a component.

Then, you'll be asked to fight multiple rounds with the usher. You'll
call out all blows that hit you loud enough that the watching marshals
can hear. It's also good to call out blows that you are not accepting
(say "cloth," "flat," "tip drag," "slap," etc. as appropriate). The
point of the practical test to to determine that you are both throwing
and accepting blows properly and that you're otherwise safe. These
rounds generally start out slowly and gradually increase in speed. Your
opponent may close in or move at full tournament speed to check your
control when potentially overwhelmed but should not do anything illegal
or unsafe.

At a few points during your practical test the marshals may call "hold"
and ask you to step away while they discuss you. Use this time to catch
your breath but be ready to continue when they're done. The practical
portion of an authorization should generally take less than ten minutes.

After a last discussion, the marshals and usher will ask you to come
over and discuss the authorization. They will then inform you of the
results of your authorization and (particularly on a failure) they'll
offer suggestions for improvement.

If you passed, return to the MoL and complete your paperwork. You'll
need to get the signatures of the two marshals on your new temporary
card. A permanent authorization card will be mailed to you in a few
weeks. If you want to participate in the day's tournament make sure
you're signed up on that list.

If you failed, please return to the MoL and inform them. While you may
not participate in the day's tournament, you may check with the RMiC,
inform him that you failed, and ask to be allowed to do "pick-up" bouts
during the day. If he has the space and time for pick-ups he may allow
you to do so. Please inform any opponents that you face that you are not
an authorized fencer and would appreciate any feedback they may have for
improvement. It's an excellent opportunity. Don't feel bad about failing
to authorize. Everyone can have an off day or get test-taking jitters.
Practice some more. Work on addressing the suggestions from your
authorization team and any pick-up bouts and try again.

### The Academie 'd Espee

All authorized fencers in Atlantia are invited to join the [Academie d'Espee](http://www.academiedespee.com/) with the rank of Scholar.
Scholars are indicated by the blue scarves that they wear on their arms.
Gold and white scarves indicate higher ranks (Free Scholar and Provost respectively) in the Academie.

The Academie is a very positive organization that adds a lot to the camaraderie of the rapier community.
Participation in the Academie is optional.
Ask your friends about it and/or read up on the group at the website linked above.
